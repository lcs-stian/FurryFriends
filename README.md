# Furry Friends 

Your task is to expand this app using one or both of the following JSON endpoints...

## Cats
https://aws.random.cat/meow

## Dogs
https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random

### Requirements

How could you expand this app?

That is up to you.

Functionality and appearance of your app may vary.

However, your app should demonstrate your ability:

* to organize a project using groups
* to write human-readable code, by:
    * using capital-casing for structure names and source code filenames
    * using camel-casing for variable, constant, function, and property names
    * writing brief comments that describe your intent
    * including appropriate whitespace
    * ensuring your code is well-indented
* to make good use of source control, by:
    * commiting frequently
    * writing descriptive commit messages
* to use abstraction
     * via helper views
     * by using functions
* to retrieve data from a JSON endpoint
* to store data in a list
* to persist data permanently
